    <h1>Echo Cell: Operative Field Dossier</h1>
    <p>You were not recruited. You were observed. You were measured. And you were found viable.</p>

    <div class="code">
      IDENTITY: Redhand<br>
      CLEARANCE: PROVISIONAL<br>
      CELL NODE: Delta-11<br>
      STATUS: MONITORED
    </div>

    <p>Echo Cell is not a faction. It's not a clan. It's a presence—embedded in the systems of Arrakis. We don't claim territory. We claim leverage.</p>

    <p>Your mission will not come with a waypoint. You will not be told when it begins. It already has.</p>

    <p>Operators are selected based on intuition, discretion, and nerve. If you speak too loudly, you will never hear from us again. If you vanish without a trace, we’ll know you were never ready.</p>

    <p>You are expected to blend in. To act natural. To build trust with the unsuspecting. Then, when the directive arrives—you execute.</p>

    <p>If you accept this role, remember: Echo Cell does not protect. It observes. It influences. And when necessary, it removes.</p>

    <p><em>Welcome to the silence.</em></p>
